KDE Plasma 6.4+ KWin script for snapping windows into zones with connected
tile resizing and runtime merged zones.

[![KDE Store](https://img.shields.io/badge/KDE%20Store-download-blue?logo=KDE)](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/2355641/) [![AUR](https://img.shields.io/badge/AUR-kwin--scripts--magnetile-1793D1?logo=archlinux)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/kwin-scripts-magnetile) [![Layout Editor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Layout%20Editor-GitHub%20Pages-00856f)](https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/)

Magnetile keeps a FancyZones-style zone workflow and extends it for a
Wayland-only KDE Plasma 6 setup with connected resizing, stronger multi-monitor
behavior, and a visual layout editor helper.

## Visual Layout Editor

Use the hosted editor to create and tune layouts without writing JSON by hand:

[https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/](https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/)

The editor can import your current Magnetile layout JSON, edit zones visually,
configure custom edge-snap triggers, and export JSON for Magnetile, KZones, or
PlasmaZones.

## What's New In 0.2.0

Magnetile 0.2.0 adds runtime merged zones. While dragging a window, drop near
the shared edge between adjacent zones to snap across both zones instead of
choosing only one. Magnetile highlights the larger merged target before release,
then keeps the merged area active until the layout is reset with `Ctrl+Alt+R`.

Existing tiled windows in the affected zones expand to the same merged target,
so a newly merged area does not leave older windows hidden underneath.

Development of the Magnetile-specific changes is AI-assisted. Human review,
testing, packaging, and licensing responsibility remain with the Magnetile
contributors.

## Features

### Magnetile-Specific Features

These features distinguish Magnetile from the original KZones base.

#### Fluid Connected Resizing

Resize a snapped window with the mouse and adjacent snapped windows on the same
output, virtual desktop, activity, and layout resize live with it so the tile
group stays connected. Future snaps on that output use the adjusted runtime
grid until the script reloads or the configuration changes.

Recorded on 5120x1440.

#### Runtime Merged Zones

Drop a dragged window near the shared edge between adjacent zones to create a
temporary merged zone. Magnetile shows a larger highlighted preview when the
drop position will span multiple zones. Dropping in the middle of a zone keeps
normal single-zone snapping.

Runtime merges are scoped to the current output, desktop, activity, and layout.
The original member zones stop acting as independent snap targets until the
current layout is reset with `Ctrl+Alt+R`.

If another tiled window already occupies one of the zones that becomes part of
the merge, Magnetile expands that window to the same merged target instead of
leaving it underneath or marking it floating.

Zone highlights and merge previews use a fixed cyan indicator for now so the
merge state stands apart from theme-derived overlay colors.

### Troubleshooting Runtime State

When testing from a source checkout, keep only one Magnetile instance enabled.
Running an installed `magnetile` package and a live `magnetile-test` script at
the same time can make both instances react to the same move or resize, causing
padding loss or stale zone state. Disable the packaged instance before using
`make reload` for source testing.

#### Free Movement

Press `Ctrl+Alt+F` to toggle free movement for the active window. If you press
it while dragging a window, the current drop will stay at the custom size and
position. Press `Ctrl+Alt+F` again, or use any zone shortcut or snap shortcut,
to put the window back under Magnetile control.

#### Visual Layout Editor

Use the standalone browser editor at
[https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/](https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/)
to design layouts without writing JSON by hand. The editor previews padding,
screen ratios, zone alignment snapping, and Magnetile custom edge-snap
triggers, then exports the shared layout JSON schema used by Magnetile, KZones,
and
[PlasmaZones](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones).

#### Multi-Monitor Presets

Each KWin output can seed its own default layout. Runtime layout switching can
be tracked independently per monitor, and optionally per virtual desktop.

### KZones-Inherited Workflow

Magnetile keeps the familiar zone selector, drag overlay, edge snapping,
multiple layouts, shortcuts, and Plasma-aware theming from its KZones base.

### Zone Selector

Drag a window toward the top of the current monitor to reveal a compact layout
picker. Drop onto a zone preview to send the window there without cycling
layouts first.

![](./media/selector.gif)

### Zone Overlay

While moving a window, Magnetile can draw the active layout over the current
monitor. Releasing the window over a highlighted zone snaps it into that zone.

![](./media/dragdrop.gif)

### Edge Snapping

Optional edge snapping lets a window target nearby zones when the pointer is
close to a monitor edge. Disable KDE's built-in edge snap first if the two
behaviors conflict.

Zones can optionally define custom edge trigger regions with `snapEdge`,
`snapX`, and `snapWidth`. This is useful for overlapping layouts where the
screen edge that selects a zone should differ from the zone's placement
geometry.

For example, an overlapping fullscreen plus left/right split layout can use the
top edge for fullscreen and the side edges for the split zones:

```json
[
  { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 100, "height": 100, "snapEdge": "top" },
  { "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 50, "height": 100, "snapEdge": "left" },
  { "x": 50, "y": 0, "width": 50, "height": 100, "snapEdge": "right" }
]
```

![](./media/edgesnapping.gif)

### Multiple Layouts

Keep several percentage-based layouts and switch between them with shortcuts,
the selector, or per-monitor defaults.

![](./media/layouts.gif)

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Shortcut actions cover moving windows to zones, switching layouts, moving to
neighboring zones, cycling windows in a zone, and snapping all visible windows.

### Theming

Overlay and selector colors follow the active Plasma color scheme.

## Requirements

- KDE Plasma 6.4 or newer
- KWin 6 on Wayland
- `kpackagetool6`
- `qdbus6`
- `make`
- `zip`, or Python 3 for the Makefile fallback packager

## Installation

Clone and install locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jcearnal/magnetile.git
cd magnetile
make
kwriteconfig6 --file kwinrc --group Plugins --key magnetileEnabled true
qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin reconfigure
qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /Scripting org.kde.kwin.Scripting.start
```

After installing, open:

`System Settings / Window Management / KWin Scripts`

Enable **Magnetile** if it is not already enabled. Open Magnetile's settings
with the gear button next to the script entry.

When updating an existing install, KWin may keep an older script instance alive.
For normal QML/config changes, use the clean reload helper:

```sh
tools/reload-clean.sh --normal
```

If shortcut declarations or signal handlers changed, or if old development
loads still appear in KWin logs, restart KWin after installing:

```sh
tools/reload-clean.sh --restart
```

The restart path calls `qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin org.kde.KWin.replace`.

## Configuration

Open the settings from:

`System Settings / Window Management / KWin Scripts / Magnetile / ⚙️`

### General

#### Basic workflow

1. Pick or create a layout in the **Layouts** tab.
2. Move a window into a zone with `Ctrl+Alt+1..9`, the top zone selector, or
   edge snapping if enabled.
3. Switch layouts with `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1..9` or cycle with `Ctrl+Alt+D`.
4. Resize a snapped window by dragging an edge. Adjacent snapped windows in the
   same layout follow after release.
5. Drop near a shared zone edge to temporarily merge adjacent zones; press
   `Ctrl+Alt+R` to restore the configured layout.
6. Press `Ctrl+Alt+F` when a window should temporarily ignore Magnetile drag
   snapping.

#### Zone Selector

Controls whether the top-of-screen layout picker appears while dragging a
window, and how close the pointer needs to be before it opens.

#### Zone Overlay

Controls the moving-window overlay, when it appears, how zones are highlighted,
and whether indicators show every zone or only the target zone.

#### Edge Snapping

Controls whether monitor edges can trigger zone targeting and how far from an
edge the pointer can be before snapping begins.

#### Remember and restore window geometries

Stores a window's floating geometry before it enters a zone and restores that
geometry when it leaves Magnetile management.

#### Track active layout per screen

Keeps the active layout separate for each KWin output. This is the setting that
enables independent monitor presets.

#### Automatically snap all new windows

Snaps new normal windows to the nearest zone as they appear.

#### Display OSD messages

Shows or hides layout-change OSD messages.

#### Fade windows while moving

Temporarily dims other windows while one window is being moved.

#### Free active window

`Ctrl+Alt+F` toggles free movement for the active window. A freed window keeps
its custom size and position when dragged, and Magnetile will not show the
snap overlay for that window. Press `Ctrl+Alt+F` again, or snap the window to a
zone, to return it to normal Magnetile control.

### Layouts

You can define your own layouts in the **Layouts** tab in the script settings.
`layoutsJson` is still the source of truth, but you do not have to hand-edit it
from scratch. The recommended workflow is to copy the JSON into the hosted
editor, make changes visually, then paste the exported Magnetile JSON back into
the settings field.

#### Visual layout editor

The visual layout editor is available on GitHub Pages:

[https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/](https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/)

The source lives in [web-editor/](./web-editor/). For local development, run a
static server from the repository root and open `/web-editor/`:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open:

`http://localhost:8000/web-editor/`

The customizer is a browser helper, not a KWin settings page. It cannot write
KWin settings directly.

To use it:

1. Open Magnetile settings from `System Settings / Window Management / KWin
   Scripts / Magnetile / ⚙️`.
2. Go to the **Layouts** tab.
3. Copy the full JSON from the layout text box.
4. Open [the visual layout editor](https://jcearnal.github.io/magnetile/).
5. Paste the JSON into the editor's JSON box and click **Import pasted JSON**.
6. Edit layouts and zones visually.
7. Keep **Magnetile** selected as the export target and click **Copy JSON**.
8. Paste the generated JSON back into Magnetile's **Layouts** tab.
9. Apply the settings, then disable and enable Magnetile or restart KWin if the
   new layout does not appear immediately.

The editor can also export KZones-compatible layout JSON. KZones and
[PlasmaZones](https://github.com/fuddlesworth/PlasmaZones) users can select
**KZones / PlasmaZones** as the export target and paste the generated JSON into
their script's layout settings. For KZones, use
`System Settings / Window Management / KWin Scripts / KZones / Layouts`.

You can also open and save `.json` files in the editor for backup or reuse.

The helper editor can:

- Create, rename, duplicate, delete, and reorder layouts.
- Add and delete zones.
- Move and resize zones by dragging.
- Snap zone edges to a grid, screen edges, or other zones.
- Preview common screen ratios and custom preview sizes.
- Preview layout padding on the canvas.
- Edit zone `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, optional `color`, and optional custom
  edge snapping fields precisely.

To configure custom edge snapping in the editor, select a zone and use the
**Top**, **Right**, **Bottom**, and **Left** checkboxes to choose which screen
edge activates that zone. Set **Snap X %** to the start of the trigger strip
and **Snap Width %** to its size. For top and bottom edges these values are
horizontal percentages; for left and right edges they are vertical percentages.
Leave all edge checkboxes unchecked to use Magnetile's legacy edge snapping for
that zone.

KWin's generic scripted config window cannot host a full drag/resize editor with
custom save logic, so the helper keeps the existing KWin config model intact.

#### Schema

The top-level value is an array of layout objects.

Each **layout** object supports:

- `name`: The name of the layout, shown when cycling between layouts
- `padding`: The amount of space between the window and the zone in pixels
- `zones`: An array containing all zone objects for this layout

Each **zone** object supports:

- `x`, `y`: position of the top left corner of the zone in screen percentage
- `width`, `height`: size of the zone in screen percentage
- `snapEdge`: screen edge or edges that activate this zone during edge snapping
  (optional). Valid values are `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`; use either
  a string or an array of strings.
- `snapX`: start of the custom edge trigger strip in screen percentage
  (optional, default `0`). For `top`/`bottom`, this is horizontal. For
  `left`/`right`, this is vertical.
- `snapWidth`: width of the custom edge trigger strip in screen percentage
  (optional, default `100`). For `top`/`bottom`, this is horizontal. For
  `left`/`right`, this is vertical.
- `applications`: an array of window classes that should snap to this zone when launched (optional)
- `indicator`: an object containing the indicator settings (optional)
  - `position`: default is `center`, other options are `top-left`, `top-center`, `top-right`, `right-center`, `bottom-right`, `bottom-center`, `bottom-left`, `left-center`
  - `margin`: an object containing the margin for the indicator
    - `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`: margin in pixels
- `color`: a color name or hex value to tint the zone with (optional)

Custom edge snapping only changes the trigger region used while dragging near a
screen edge. The zone still places windows using its normal `x`, `y`, `width`,
and `height`, including runtime resized or merged geometry.

### Per-Monitor Layouts

Enable **Track active layout per screen** to keep a separate active layout for
each physical output. Magnetile keys this by KWin output name, so monitor
arrangements can be left, right, above, below, or use negative virtual
coordinates.

Use **Monitor layout defaults** to seed a specific output or orientation with a
layout. The value is a JSON object whose keys are KWin output names,
`landscape`, or `portrait`, and whose values are layout names or zero-based
layout indexes:

```json
{
    "DP-1": "Priority Grid",
    "HDMI-A-1": 1,
    "landscape": "Priority Grid",
    "portrait": "Horizontal Split"
}
```

If no valid output or orientation default is set, Magnetile uses `Priority Grid`
on landscape outputs and `Horizontal Split` on portrait outputs when those
layouts exist. Orientation is part of the runtime per-screen key, so rotating a
monitor seeds a separate active layout for that orientation.

After a monitor has an active layout, layout switching on that monitor updates
only that monitor's runtime selection. If **Track active layout per virtual
desktop** is also enabled, Magnetile tracks the output and virtual desktop
together.

### Filters

Stop certain windows from snapping to zones by adding them to the filter list.

- Select **Include** or **Exclude** mode.
- Add one window class per line.

You can enable the debug overlay to see the window class of the active window.

### Advanced

#### Polling rate

The polling rate controls how often Magnetile checks hover state while dragging
a window. Lower values feel more responsive and use more CPU.

#### Debugging

Enable script logging or show the runtime debug overlay. The debug overlay is
useful for finding a window's resource class for filters or application-based
zone rules.

#### Activity Layout Tracking

Enable **Track active layout per activity** to remember the selected layout
separately for each KDE Activity. Existing windows can also keep separate
runtime placements per activity after they are moved or resized in each
activity. Magnetile restores those remembered placements when switching
activities, but it does not launch activity-specific apps or persist this
runtime placement state across KWin restarts.

*To change the default bindings, go to `System Settings / Shortcuts` and search for Magnetile*

> [!NOTE]  
> Not all shortcuts will be bound by default as they conflict with existing system bindings.

## Cycling Stacked Windows

Multiple windows can occupy the same Magnetile zone. Use `Ctrl+Alt+Up` and
`Ctrl+Alt+Down` to cycle through visible windows in the active window's current
zone. The OSD reports the zone, stack position, stack size, and selected window.

Zone cycling is scoped to the same output, virtual desktop, activity, and
layout. Minimized windows are skipped.

## Testing Connected Resize

1. Open three normal windows.
2. Move them into the default Priority Grid using `Ctrl+Alt+1`, `Ctrl+Alt+2`, and `Ctrl+Alt+3`.
3. Resize the center window with the mouse by dragging its left or right edge.
4. The adjacent window sharing that edge should resize live while dragging.
5. Release the mouse and confirm the final geometry remains connected.
6. For padded layouts, the visual gap between connected windows should remain.
7. For split stacks, resize the full-height neighbor to move both stacked
   windows together. If you grab one half of the stack by accident, the matching
   split sibling should keep the same outer edge aligned.
8. Snap another window into one of the resized zones. It should use the current
   resized grid, not the original JSON layout dimensions.
9. Press `Ctrl+Alt+R`. Windows in the current layout on the active output
   should return to the configured layout geometry.

Enable debug logging or the debug overlay when a nearby window does not follow
a resize. These are independent toggles: logging writes the resize group to
KWin logs, while the overlay shows the same resize summary while dragging.
Magnetile reports the active resize group, participating windows, and windows
skipped because they were filtered or outside the current scope.

If the resize debug overlay remains visible after disabling it, reload the
current script build. A normal reload should be enough for config-only changes:

```sh
tools/reload-clean.sh --normal
```

If the overlay was created by an older running QML instance, restart KWin:

```sh
tools/reload-clean.sh --restart
```

While daily driving Magnetile, useful things to note are resize jitter, windows
that do not follow a resize, duplicated-looking resize participants, apps that
resist requested geometry, stale shortcuts after reloads, and behavior changes
after monitor, desktop, activity, or scaling changes.

## Testing Free Movement

1. Move a window into a zone.
2. Press `Ctrl+Alt+F`; the OSD should say **Free movement enabled**.
3. Drag the window. The zone overlay should stay hidden and the window should
   keep the custom drop position.
4. Press `Ctrl+Alt+F` again; the OSD should say **Free movement disabled**.
5. Drag the window again. Magnetile snapping should be available again.

## Testing Screenshot Region Selection

Magnetile ignores KDE Spectacle capture windows so `Meta+Shift+S` can select
regions across the full output even when `Automatically snap all new windows`
is enabled.

1. Press `Meta+Shift+S`.
2. Drag a region across each active Magnetile zone.
3. Confirm the selector is not limited to a zone and the saved capture is not
   offset from the selected region.

## Tips and Tricks

### Animate window movements

Install the "Geometry change" KWin effect to animate window movements: https://store.kde.org/p/2136283

### Trigger KWin shortcuts using a command

Replace the last part with any shortcut from the list above:

```sh
qdbus6 org.kde.kglobalaccel /component/kwin invokeShortcut "Magnetile: Cycle layouts"
```

### Clean corrupted shortcuts

Sometimes KWin can leave behind corrupt or missing shortcuts in the Settings after uninstalling or updating scripts, you can remove those using this command:

```sh
qdbus6 org.kde.kglobalaccel /component/kwin org.kde.kglobalaccel.Component.cleanUp
```

## Troubleshooting

### The script doesn't work

Confirm you are running KDE Plasma 6.4+ on Wayland and that the Layouts setting
contains at least one layout with at least one zone.

### My settings are not saved

After changing settings, disable and enable the script again. KWin scripted
config reloads can be inconsistent.

### I cannot find the layout customizer

The visual customizer is not opened from System Settings. Open the local file
`tools/layout-editor.html` from the cloned Magnetile repository in a browser,
then copy JSON between the browser helper and Magnetile's **Layouts** settings
tab.

### A freed window will not snap anymore

Press `Ctrl+Alt+F` again while the window is active, or use any zone shortcut
such as `Ctrl+Alt+1`. The OSD reports whether free movement is enabled or
disabled.

### A monitor comes back at the wrong resolution after lock or resume

Magnetile does not control monitor EDID detection, display modes, wallpaper
assignment, SDDM, or timezone settings. If KDE Display Configuration shows a
monitor as an unexpected fallback device, such as `Nvidia DP-3-0000`, and KWin
only exposes a low resolution such as `640x480`, the display stack has likely
failed to read the monitor's real EDID after lock, sleep, or cable/link churn.

Check the live KScreen state:

```sh
kscreen-doctor -o
```

If the affected output only lists the fallback mode, force KDE to re-probe that
output by disabling and re-enabling it. Replace `DP-3` with the affected output
name:

```sh
kscreen-doctor output.DP-3.disable
sleep 2
kscreen-doctor output.DP-3.enable
```

After the monitor redetects correctly, `kscreen-doctor -o` should show the real
monitor identity and modes again. Magnetile guards against acting while KWin's
output geometry is changing, but it cannot repair a monitor link that KDE or
the graphics driver currently reports with bad EDID data.

### Logs

Follow KWin scripting logs while testing:

```sh
journalctl --user -u plasma-kwin_wayland -f QT_CATEGORY=kwin_scripting QT_CATEGORY=qml QT_CATEGORY=js
```

### Plasma 5 and X11

Magnetile targets KDE Plasma 6.4+ and Wayland. Plasma 5 and X11 are not supported.

## Relationship to KZones

Magnetile is not presented as an original clean-room replacement for KZones. It
is derived from [KZones](https://github.com/gerritdevriese/kzones) and keeps
KZones attribution in [NOTICE.md](./NOTICE.md). Because KZones is GPL-3.0,
Magnetile is distributed under GPL-3.0 as well.

The goal is to preserve compatible KZones behavior while making targeted
improvements for modern Plasma 6 Wayland workflows.

### Preserved KZones Features

Magnetile keeps the original KZones-style workflow and feature set, including:

- FancyZones-style custom layouts made from percentage-based zones.
- A top-of-screen zone selector while dragging windows.
- A visual zone overlay while moving windows.
- Optional edge snapping.
- Multiple saved layouts.
- Keyboard shortcuts for moving windows to zones, cycling layouts, switching
  layouts, moving to neighboring zones, cycling windows in a zone, and snapping
  windows.
- Plasma color-scheme aware overlay and selector styling.
- JSON-based layout configuration.

These features come from the KZones base and are preserved so existing KZones
users have a familiar workflow.

### New In Magnetile

Compared with the original KZones base, Magnetile adds:

- Fluid connected resizing: adjacent tiled windows resize while a snapped
  window is manually resized, and later snaps can follow the resized runtime
  grid.
- Runtime merged zones: drag near a shared zone edge to temporarily snap across
  adjacent zones, with an expanded preview and coherent handling for existing
  windows in the merged area.
- KDE Plasma 6 / KWin 6 Wayland focus with no X11-specific code paths.
- Resolution-independent geometry fixes for multi-monitor layouts, including
  outputs that do not start at `x=0, y=0`.
- Per-monitor layout defaults through `monitorLayoutsJson`.
- Independent active-layout tracking per output and optionally per virtual
  desktop.
- Free movement overrides for temporarily dragging a window outside Magnetile's
  snap grid.
- A visual layout editor helper for creating, renaming, duplicating, deleting,
  reordering, previewing, importing, and exporting JSON layouts.
- Editor support for snapping, padding preview, preview aspect ratios, and
  saved JSON layout files.
- Documentation for the current architecture, schema choices, local testing,
  and known KWin scripted-config limitations.

See `PROJECT_DESIGN.md` for the future-session handoff, including the phased
runtime merged-zones plan for multi-zone snapping.
