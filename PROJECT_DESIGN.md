# Magnetile Project Design

This file is the handoff document for future development sessions. Read it before changing behavior.

## Goal

Magnetile is a KDE Plasma 6.4+ KWin script for Wayland. It combines:

- KZones-style PowerToys FancyZones behavior: percentage-based custom zones, visual overlay, zone selector, edge snapping, layout switching, and shortcuts.
- Fluid Tile-style connected resizing: when a tiled window is manually resized, adjacent tiled windows resize to fill the space automatically.

Magnetile should preserve existing KZones behavior unless a change is explicitly fixing a bug or adding connected tiling behavior.

## Platform Constraints

- KWin 6 API only.
- Plasma 6.4+ minimum.
- Wayland only. Do not add X11-specific code paths.
- Use `qdbus6`, not `qdbus`.
- Geometry must be resolution-independent. Layout zones are percentages. Do not hardcode monitor-size assumptions.
- Must work on 1080p, 1440p, 4K, ultrawide, high DPI, fractional scaling, and multi-monitor setups.

## Licensing

Magnetile is derived from KZones. KZones is GPL-3.0, so Magnetile is GPL-3.0 unless upstream KZones grants relicensing permission. Keep KZones attribution and Magnetile attribution in `NOTICE.md`.

Magnetile-specific changes are developed with AI coding assistance. Treat that
as an implementation detail, not a licensing shortcut: preserve the GPL-3.0
license, keep upstream KZones attribution, and document Magnetile improvements
as derivative work rather than clean-room authorship.

## Current Architecture

The package root is `src/`.

- `src/metadata.json`: KWin script package metadata. Plugin id is `magnetile`.
- `src/contents/ui/main.qml`: main runtime, KWin signal handling, zone movement, layout state, connected resizing, overlay dialog.
- `src/contents/ui/components/Shortcuts.qml`: all KGlobalAccel shortcut declarations.
- `src/contents/ui/components/Zones.qml`: visual zone overlay geometry.
- `src/contents/ui/components/Selector.qml`: top zone selector.
- `src/contents/code/core.mjs`: config loading and shared runtime state.
- `src/contents/code/utils.mjs`: logging, OSD, hover helpers.
- `src/contents/config/main.xml`: KWin script config schema.
- `src/contents/ui/config.ui`: settings UI.
- `tools/layout-editor.html`: standalone browser helper for visual layout editing.

The code intentionally remains close to KZones. Avoid large rewrites unless they are necessary.

## Active Runtime Source

Before testing runtime behavior, verify which Magnetile source KWin is actually
running. The user's normal working session may run the installed package at:

```text
~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/magnetile/
```

That installed package can differ from this checkout's `src/` tree. Loading
`src/contents/ui/main.qml` directly with `loadDeclarativeScript` changes the
runtime source for the active session and can make behavior differ from the
user's installed Magnetile package. In May 2026, this caused connected resize to
appear broken because the checkout and installed package had different resize
logic.

Future development sessions must decide explicitly which source is under test:

- To test the installed/user-facing package, use KWin's plugin enable/reconfigure
  flow and inspect `~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/magnetile/`.
- To test checkout changes, install or reload the checkout intentionally, and
  tell the user that the running KWin script now comes from the checkout.
- Do not assume live behavior matches this checkout until logs confirm the
  loaded script path.

Useful checks:

```bash
qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /Scripting org.kde.kwin.Scripting.isScriptLoaded magnetile
journalctl --user -u plasma-kwin_wayland --since '5 minutes ago' --no-pager | rg 'Magnetile: Loading script|Loading script'
diff -u src/contents/ui/main.qml ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/magnetile/contents/ui/main.qml
```

## Layout Editing Architecture

`layoutsJson` remains the source of truth for layouts. The schema is still a
backward-compatible array of layout objects, and all zones remain percentages.
Optional fields such as `applications`, `indicator`, `color`, `fullscreen`, and
future metadata are preserved by the JSON parser and helper editor where
possible.

The built-in KWin scripted config UI is a static QWidget `.ui` loaded by KDE's
generic scripted config module. It is suitable for storing `kcfg_*` fields but
not for a FancyZones-style drag/resize editor with custom save logic. The first
visual editor milestone is therefore `tools/layout-editor.html`, a local helper
that can import current layout JSON, edit layouts and zones visually, and copy
the resulting JSON back into the Magnetile Layouts setting.

Implemented helper editor operations:

- Create, rename, duplicate, delete, and reorder layouts.
- Add and delete zones.
- Move and resize zones by dragging in a resolution-independent canvas.
- Snap zone edges to a grid, screen edges, and other zones.
- Preview layout padding and common/custom screen aspect ratios.
- Import pasted JSON, open JSON files, save JSON files, and copy generated JSON.
- Edit zone `x`, `y`, `width`, `height`, and optional `color` precisely.

A future fully integrated editor should be either:

- A custom KCM or external helper that writes the KWin script config directly
  and triggers a KWin reconfigure, or
- A runtime KWin QML editor only if the deployed KWin API exposes a reliable
  script config write path.

Do not replace `layoutsJson` with pixel geometry. Any migration must keep old
arrays valid and make new fields optional.

## Per-Monitor Layout Defaults

`monitorLayoutsJson` is an optional JSON object mapping KWin output names,
`landscape`, or `portrait` to a layout name or zero-based layout index:

```json
{
  "DP-1": "Priority Grid",
  "HDMI-A-1": 1,
  "landscape": "Priority Grid",
  "portrait": "Horizontal Split"
}
```

This map is only used when `trackLayoutPerScreen` is enabled. On first use of an
output/desktop layout key, Magnetile seeds the active layout from
`monitorLayoutsJson`; output-name defaults take precedence over orientation
defaults. If no valid mapping exists, landscape outputs prefer `Priority Grid`
and portrait outputs prefer `Horizontal Split` when those layouts exist. After
seeding, runtime layout switching is tracked
independently in memory for that output, and optionally for that virtual desktop
when `trackLayoutPerDesktop` is also enabled. When
`trackLayoutPerActivity` is enabled, the active KDE Activity id is also part of
the runtime layout key, so each activity can remember its own active layout.

When activity layout tracking is enabled, each client also keeps an in-memory
`magnetileActivityPlacements` map keyed by output, virtual desktop, and KDE
Activity id. Magnetile updates that map when it tiles, frees, resets, or
connected-resizes a window. On `Workspace.currentActivityChanged`, visible
windows belonging to the new activity are restored from the matching placement
entry. This is intentionally runtime state only; Magnetile does not launch apps
or persist activity placements across KWin restarts.

Monitor identity uses KWin output names (`output.name`). Geometry does not rely
on output order or an origin of `x=0, y=0`; snapping uses
`Workspace.clientArea(KWin.FullScreenArea, output, desktop)` plus percentage
zones. Output orientation is included in the runtime layout key so rotating a
monitor seeds and remembers a separate layout selection for that orientation.

## Zone Geometry

Layout zones are stored as percentages:

```json
{ "x": 0, "y": 0, "width": 25, "height": 100 }
```

Runtime conversion happens in `zoneGeometry(layoutIndex, zoneIndex, screen)` in `main.qml`.

Important details:

- Always include the client area offset (`area.x`, `area.y`) when converting percentage zones to absolute geometry.
- Use `Workspace.clientArea(KWin.FullScreenArea, screen, Workspace.currentDesktop)` for current zone behavior.
- Use tolerant geometry matching. Exact equality is fragile with Wayland scaling and KWin rounding.
- Optional zone `snapEdge`, `snapX`, and `snapWidth` fields only customize
  edge-snap trigger regions. They must not change placement geometry,
  shortcuts, connected resize, runtime resized geometry, merged zone storage,
  snap-all, or layout switching. Overlay hover continues to use target geometry;
  when targets overlap, the smaller containing target wins so a fullscreen zone
  does not mask narrower zones.

## Window State

Magnetile tracks state as dynamic properties on KWin windows:

- `client.zone`: active zone index, or `-1`.
- `client.layout`: active layout index.
- `client.desktop`: desktop captured when assigning the zone.
- `client.activity`: activity captured when assigning the zone.
- `client.oldGeometry`: previous floating geometry when restore behavior is enabled.
- `client.magnetileResizeSnapshot`: temporary snapshot used during connected resize.
- `client.magnetileFreeMove`: window-level override that prevents drag/drop
  snapping until toggled off or until the window is explicitly snapped to a
  zone again.

When adding new state, prefix Magnetile-specific temporary fields with `magnetile`.

## Connected Resize

Connected resizing lives in `main.qml`.

Flow:

1. `onInteractiveMoveResizeStarted` detects `client.resize`.
2. If the client is in a known zone, `snapshotResizeGroup(client)` captures:
   - resized window geometry,
   - layout,
   - zone,
   - output,
   - desktop,
   - activity,
   - other tiled windows in the same scope.
   If KWin script reloads have cleared Magnetile's dynamic window properties,
   the snapshot path first recovers the resized window's layout/zone from its
   current frame geometry across all configured layouts, then recovers other
   same-layout windows in the resize scope.
3. `onInteractiveMoveResizeStepped` calls `connectedResize(client)` during the
   drag so adjacent windows follow live. The solver always compares against the
   original snapshot, not against already-mutated neighbor windows.
4. `onInteractiveMoveResizeFinished` calls `connectedResize(client)` again as
   the final correctness pass.
5. `connectedResize` compares the resized window's old and new edges.
6. Adjacent windows whose old edge touched the resized edge, or whose old edge
   was separated by the layout padding gap, are resized to follow the new edge.
   Padded layouts preserve the measured gap between the resized window and the
   neighbor instead of collapsing the windows together.
7. If the dragged edge would consume an adjacent neighbor past the minimum
   tracked size, Magnetile constrains the dragged window before applying
   neighbor geometry so the solver does not leave overlapping windows behind.
8. Resize snapshots store both current frame geometry and original logical zone
   geometry. Neighbor detection can use either source so full-height zones can
   stay connected to stacked half-height zones across their shared logical edge.
9. Stacked or side-by-side sibling zones that share the same logical outer edge
   follow that edge together, so accidentally grabbing one half of a split stack
   still keeps the other half aligned.
10. `Ctrl+Alt+R` clears the current layout's resized runtime geometry for the
   active output, desktop, and activity, then moves windows in that layout back
   to their configured zone geometry. If a window's dynamic layout/zone state is
   stale, reset falls back to the nearest configured zone.

Scope rules:

- Only normal, non-filtered windows participate.
- Only same output/screen.
- Only same virtual desktop.
- Only same activity.
- Only same Magnetile layout.

When `enableDebugLogging` is enabled, resize start logs include the active
layout/zone, resize participants, and same-session windows skipped because they
were filtered or outside the resize scope. `enableDebugOverlay` is independent
from logging and opens a resize-only debug dialog with the current resize
snapshot summary while a window is being resized. The resize debug dialog is
shown and hidden explicitly on resize start/end and config reload because
`PlasmaCore.Dialog` visibility bindings can remain stale across KWin script
reloads.

The implementation is edge-adjacent, not a full tile-tree solver. It works best for non-overlapping grids and shared-edge layouts.

## Planned Runtime Merged Zones

Issue #6 requests snapping a window across multiple adjacent zones. Implement
this as runtime merged zones rather than only applying a larger window
rectangle. A multi-zone snap should temporarily mutate the effective layout for
the active output, desktop, activity, and layout until `Ctrl+Alt+R` resets that
runtime state.

The core rule is that once zones are merged, their member zones stop being
independent snap targets. For example, if zones 1 and 2 are merged for a window,
the overlay should show one combined target and another window should not be
able to snap into only zone 1 underneath it. This prevents overlapping tiled
state and keeps the preview consistent with the actual snap behavior.

Keep configured layout JSON immutable. The effective runtime layout should be:

```text
configured layout
+ runtime resize geometry
+ runtime merged zones
= effective snap/render targets
```

Add one shared target layer and make overlay rendering, hover detection, and
drop behavior consume it:

```js
function effectiveZoneTargets(layout, screen, desktop, activity) {
    // Return normal zones plus merged zones after hiding merge member zones.
}
```

Each target should carry the data needed by both rendering and snapping:

```js
{
    type: "merge",              // or "zone"
    id: "0,1",                  // stable id for merged zones
    zone: 0,                    // anchor zone for compatibility
    zones: [0, 1],              // all occupied configured zones
    geometry: Qt.rect(...),
    color: ...,
    label: "1+2"
}
```

Store merge state separately from `config.layouts`, keyed by the same scope used
for runtime resize geometry: layout, output name, client area, desktop, and
activity. A `mergedZones` root property is enough for the first implementation.
If a new merge overlaps an existing merge, replace or clear the old overlapping
merge so no two active targets claim the same configured zone.

Window state should remain backward-compatible:

- `client.zone`: anchor zone, usually the first zone in the target.
- `client.zones`: full occupied zone array for multi-zone windows.
- `client.magnetileMergedZone`: merge id such as `"0,1"` or an empty string.
- `client.layout`, `client.desktop`, `client.activity`, and
  `client.magnetileTiled`: same meaning as today.

Use helpers instead of reading `client.zone` directly in new multi-zone logic:

- `clientZones(client)`: returns `client.zones` when valid, otherwise
  `[client.zone]`, otherwise an empty array.
- `zonesOverlap(a, b)`: true when two zone arrays share a member.
- `zonesUnionGeometry(layout, zones, screen)`: returns the bounding rectangle of
  the current runtime geometries for those zones.
- `moveClientToTarget(client, target)`: applies geometry and saves target state.

Do not try to make `config.layouts[currentLayout].zones` represent runtime
merged zones. That would make reset, user configuration, and layout editor
behavior ambiguous.

### Runtime Merged Zones Phases

Implementation status: Phases 1-5 are implemented on the
`feature/runtime-merged-zones` branch. The code now has merge state, scope keys,
zone normalization, client-zone helpers, union geometry, `effectiveZoneTargets()`,
runtime merge storage, effective-target overlay rendering, drag/drop target
resolution, conflict cleanup, reset clearing, and edge/gutter drop spanning.
Connected resize remains conservative for multi-zone windows.

Phase 1: Add the effective layout layer without changing behavior.

- Add `mergedZones` and scope-key helpers in `main.qml`.
- Add `effectiveZoneTargets()`, `targetGeometry()`, and target membership
  helpers.
- Return one normal target per configured zone when there are no merges.
- Keep existing drag/drop and shortcut behavior unchanged in this phase.

Phase 2: Add runtime merge storage and programmatic snap support.

- Add `mergeZones(layout, zones, screen, desktop, activity)`.
- Add `moveClientToTarget(client, target)`.
- Keep `moveClientToZone(client, zone)` as a compatibility wrapper around a
  single-zone target.
- Add conflict handling so overlapping merges cannot coexist.
- Make `Ctrl+Alt+R` clear merge state for the active scope.

Phase 3: Update preview and hover detection.

- Change `src/contents/ui/components/Zones.qml` to render effective targets
  instead of raw configured zones.
- Change the overlay hover loop and edge-snapping hover loop to iterate
  effective targets.
- Underlying member zones of a merge must not render or accept hover/drop.
- The target highlighted in the overlay must be the exact target used on drop.

Phase 4: Add multi-zone selection UX.

- KWin global shortcuts are not reliable during interactive window moves, so do
  not depend on held or toggled keyboard state.
- Use edge/gutter spanning: when a drop lands within the merge threshold around
  a shared edge between effective targets, create a runtime merge for those
  adjacent targets.
- Show a larger merge preview while the cursor is within that threshold so the
  user can see when the drop will span multiple zones.
- Dropping in the middle of a target keeps normal single-zone snapping.
- Only allow contiguous rectangular selections for the MVP.
- Existing tiled windows whose occupied zones overlap the new merged target move
  to the merged target as well, so zone stacks remain coherent after a merge.
- Zone highlight and merge preview indicators currently use a fixed cyan
  (`#00d5ff`) rather than the Plasma theme accent color. Tune or make this color
  configurable in a future session.

Phase 5: Sweep compatibility paths.

- Update `recoverClientZone()`, `matchZoneInLayout()`, `getWindowsInZone()`,
  fullscreen restore, snap all, snap closest, neighbor shortcuts, and debug
  output to use `clientZones()` or effective targets where appropriate.
- It is acceptable for some single-zone commands to collapse a multi-zone window
  back to one zone, but that behavior should be explicit.

Phase 6: Revisit connected resize.

- For the first merged-zone release, either exclude multi-zone windows from
  connected resize or treat the merged target as one large logical zone.
- Do not attempt internal-boundary resize behavior until the effective target
  model is stable.
- Any connected resize work should operate on effective targets rather than raw
  configured zones.

Manual tests for this feature should include:

- Merge two adjacent zones by dragging and confirm the overlay shows one target.
- Try snapping another window into one member zone and confirm it cannot land
  underneath the merged window.
- Reset with `Ctrl+Alt+R` and confirm original configured zones return.
- Repeat on a secondary monitor, another virtual desktop, and after switching
  layouts.
- Confirm normal single-zone shortcuts still work after a merge exists.

## Shortcuts

Current default shortcuts avoid numpad dependency:

- `Ctrl+Alt+1..9`: move active window to zone 1-9.
- `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1..9`: activate layout 1-9.
- `Ctrl+Alt+!/@/#...`: compatibility aliases for activate layout 1-9 on
  keyboard paths that report shifted number keys as symbols.
- `Ctrl+Alt+D`: cycle layouts.
- `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+D`: cycle layouts reversed.
- `Ctrl+Alt+Left/Right`: previous/next zone.
- `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down`: previous/next window in current zone.
- `Meta+Space`: snap all windows.
- `Meta+Shift+Space`: snap active window.
- `Ctrl+Alt+F`: free active window from Magnetile drag snapping.
- `Ctrl+Alt+C`: toggle zone overlay while moving.
- `Ctrl+Alt+R`: reset windows in the current layout back to configured zone
  geometry.

Zone stack cycling uses `Workspace.stackingOrder` scoped to the active window's
output, virtual desktop, activity, layout, and zone. Minimized windows are
skipped, duplicate object references are ignored, and the OSD reports the stack
position and selected window. Resize diagnostics group participants by zone so
stacked windows are visible while testing.

KDE keeps old bindings in `~/.config/kglobalshortcutsrc`. If shortcut defaults change, existing installs may need live KGlobalAccel updates or manual changes in System Settings.
Shortcut declaration changes and old dev-loaded signal handlers may require a
full KWin restart with `qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin org.kde.KWin.replace`.

## Free Movement

Free movement is a per-window override controlled by `Ctrl+Alt+F`.

Behavior:

- When enabled, Magnetile does not show the zone overlay for that window during
  drag moves and the drop remains at the user's custom size and position.
- Pressing `Ctrl+Alt+F` again disables the override for the active window.
- Moving the window to a zone with a zone shortcut, selector drop, or snap
  command clears the override.
- The override is stored only as a dynamic KWin window property. It does not
  survive window recreation or a full KWin restart.

This is intentionally implemented as a toggle rather than a held global key.
KWin `ShortcutHandler` activation is reliable for shortcuts, but it does not
provide a matching key-release signal that can be used as a robust global
"while held" state from the script.

## Known Limitations

- Connected resize depends on KWin's interactive resize step events, so apps
  that throttle or reject scripted geometry updates may feel less fluid.
- Overlapping configured zones are not fully solved.
- Connected resize for multi-zone windows is conservative; multi-zone windows are
  treated as merged effective targets rather than editable internal boundaries.
- Multiple windows stacked in one zone can make resize behavior ambiguous.
- Some GTK/Flatpak apps may fight requested geometry.
- KWin script config reload is unreliable; disabling/enabling or restarting KWin scripting may be needed after config changes.
- `wf-recorder` is not a valid capture backend on KWin sessions that do not
  expose `wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1`; recording tooling needs a KDE
  PipeWire/portal-compatible backend before final demo capture.

## Local Development

For normal runtime or config changes, build, install, enable, reconfigure, and
restart KWin scripting with:

```sh
tools/reload-clean.sh --normal
```

Use the full restart path when shortcut declarations changed, when signal
handler lifecycle changed, or when logs still mention stale development load
paths such as temporary `src.XXXXXX` directories:

```sh
tools/reload-clean.sh --restart
```

The full restart path packages and installs with `make`, enables Magnetile in
`kwinrc`, then calls `qdbus6 org.kde.KWin /KWin org.kde.KWin.replace`. This is
expected to be necessary for KGlobalAccel shortcut declaration changes and for
clearing old QML closures left by temporary development loads.

The `Meta+Shift+S` screenshot-region bug from April 2026 was caused by
`autoSnapAllNew` snapping KWin's Spectacle capture client
(`org.kde.spectacle`) into Magnetile zones. Magnetile now treats Spectacle as a
protected capture client and ignores it before signal connection, application
rules, autosnap, or zone matching. If screenshot selection appears restricted
to a zone again, enable debug logging and check for `Moving client
org.kde.spectacle` or another capture client in KWin logs.

The Makefile uses `zip` when available and Python's `zipfile` module as a fallback.

Watch logs:

```sh
journalctl --user -u plasma-kwin_wayland -f QT_CATEGORY=kwin_scripting QT_CATEGORY=qml QT_CATEGORY=js
```

## Manual Test Checklist

- Install and enable the script.
- Confirm KWin logs show `Magnetile: Loading config`.
- Move a window to zones 1, 2, and 3 with `Ctrl+Alt+1..3`.
- Switch layouts with `Ctrl+Alt+Shift+1..3` and confirm the numbered OSD shows
  the selected layout name.
- Drag a window to the top selector and drop into a zone.
- Move a window while overlay is visible.
- Put three windows into adjacent zones and resize the center window by mouse.
- Press `Ctrl+Alt+R` and confirm resized windows return to the configured
  layout geometry.
- Press `Ctrl+Alt+F`, drag the active window freely, then press `Ctrl+Alt+F`
  again and confirm zone snapping returns.
- Drop a window near the shared edge between adjacent zones. Confirm a larger
  merge preview appears before release, the overlay then shows the merged area
  as one snap target, and `Ctrl+Alt+R` restores the original zone split.
- Press `Meta+Shift+S` and drag screenshot regions across every active
  Magnetile zone. The selector should cover the full output and captures should
  not be offset.
- Stack two windows in the same zone, then use `Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down` to cycle the
  active window through that zone's stack.
- Use `tools/layout-editor.html` to import, edit, copy, and reapply layout JSON.
- Repeat connected resize on a secondary monitor if available.
- Test at fractional scaling if available.
- During daily-driver testing, record resize jitter, windows that fail to
  participate, duplicate-looking participants in resize diagnostics, stale
  shortcut or signal behavior after reloads, and scope bugs involving monitors,
  virtual desktops, activities, or scaling changes.

## Feature Ideas Already Requested

- Better native KWin tile API integration.
- Multi-zone spanning.
- GUI layout editor.
